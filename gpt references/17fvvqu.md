> i have an idea of making telegram userbots, bots that will simulate user activity and be interactive in chat groups and direct messages. when in chat groups they should respind to messages using their library for answers, i guess it would be simple relation, but with variations.. also in direct messages they will use special one of many scenario for interaction, which can be adjusted. after scenario ending bot will respond using library for answers for direct messages. currently i have nestjs server that can launch bot instances using child\_process and can communicate with them, waiting or not waiting for interaction to end. also i need to have module for registering a new bot. each bot need to collect statistics in chat groups and direct messages. write me step by step modules that i need to write, divide them by tasks and add description, and add approximate estimations, counting that im middle fullstack engineer. also provide schema for bot instance in db.

Sure, here are the steps and modules you can write to create your Telegram userbots:

1.  **Design the bot schema and database**: First, you need to define the schema for your bot instance in the database. You can create a table with fields like `id`, `bot_name`, `token`, `chat_id`, `scenario`, `last_interaction_time`, etc. This table will store information about all the bots you create.
    
2.  **Write a module for registering a new bot**: This module should allow you to register a new bot by adding a new row to the bot table with the required information like `bot_name`, `token`, `chat_id`, etc.
    
3.  **Create a module for launching bot instances**: This module should use the `child_process` module to launch new instances of your bot. It should read the necessary information from the bot table, create a new process for the bot, and start it.
    
4.  **Write a module for bot interaction**: This module should define how the bot interacts with users in chat groups and direct messages. It should include the library of answers for the bot to use in chat groups and scenarios for the bot to use in direct messages.
    
5.  **Implement statistics collection module**: This module should collect statistics about each bot's interactions with users, like the number of messages sent and received, the number of active users, and other relevant metrics.
    
6.  **Add a module for logging**: You should add a logging module that logs all the interactions of the bot with the users. This will help you to analyze the bot's performance, detect errors, and improve the bot's behavior.
    
7.  **Create a module for bot management**: This module should allow you to manage your bots, like starting, stopping, or restarting them. You can use this module to modify the bot's configuration, like changing the scenario or the library of answers.
    

Estimations:

1.  Designing the bot schema and database - 4 hours
2.  Writing a module for registering a new bot - 4 hours
3.  Creating a module for launching bot instances - 8 hours
4.  Writing a module for bot interaction - 16 hours
5.  Implementing statistics collection module - 12 hours
6.  Adding a module for logging - 8 hours
7.  Creating a module for bot management - 12 hours

Total estimation: 64 hours

Bot instance schema in the database:

sql

```sql
CREATE TABLE bots (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    bot_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    chat_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    scenario VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    last_interaction_time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

This schema includes the necessary fields to store the bot's name, Telegram API token, chat ID, scenario, and last interaction time. The `created_at` field stores the time when the bot was created. You can modify this schema as per your requirements.

> provide schema for statistics module

Sure, here is a possible schema for the statistics module:

sql

```sql
CREATE TABLE bot_statistics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    bot_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES bots(id),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    messages_sent INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    messages_received INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    active_users INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

This schema includes a table for storing statistics for each bot instance. The `bot_id` field is a foreign key that references the `id` field in the `bots` table. The `timestamp` field stores the time when the statistics were collected. The `messages_sent` field stores the number of messages sent by the bot. The `messages_received` field stores the number of messages received by the bot. The `active_users` field stores the number of active users interacting with the bot. The `created_at` field stores the time when the statistics record was created. You can modify this schema as per your requirements.

> in direct messages when my bot finishes scenario it should be counting as a goal. so it should be also in schema. provide schema for direct messages

Sure, here's a possible schema for the direct messages module:

sql

```sql
CREATE TABLE direct_messages (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    bot_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES bots(id),
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    scenario VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    goal_reached BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

This schema includes a table for storing direct messages sent to the bot. The `bot_id` field is a foreign key that references the `id` field in the `bots` table. The `user_id` field stores the Telegram user ID who sent the message. The `message` field stores the text of the message. The `scenario` field stores the scenario used by the bot to respond to the message. The `goal_reached` field stores a boolean value indicating whether the bot reached its goal after the scenario ended. The `created_at` field stores the time when the direct message was received.

Note that you should update the `goal_reached` field in the `direct_messages` table when the bot finishes the scenario and reaches its goal. You can modify this schema as per your requirements.

> provide typeorm entities for my project

Sure, here are the TypeORM entities for your project:

**Bot Entity**

typescript

```typescript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, OneToMany } from 'typeorm';
import { BotInstance } from './bot-instance.entity';

@Entity()
export class Bot {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Column()
  token: string;

  @OneToMany(() => BotInstance, botInstance => botInstance.bot)
  instances: BotInstance[];
}
```

**BotInstance Entity**

typescript

```typescript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, ManyToOne, OneToMany } from 'typeorm';
import { Bot } from './bot.entity';
import { BotStatistics } from './bot-statistics.entity';
import { DirectMessage } from './direct-message.entity';

@Entity()
export class BotInstance {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  chatId: string;

  @Column()
  isActive: boolean;

  @ManyToOne(() => Bot, bot => bot.instances)
  bot: Bot;

  @OneToMany(() => BotStatistics, statistics => statistics.botInstance)
  statistics: BotStatistics[];

  @OneToMany(() => DirectMessage, directMessage => directMessage.botInstance)
  directMessages: DirectMessage[];
}
```

**BotStatistics Entity**

typescript

```typescript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, ManyToOne } from 'typeorm';
import { BotInstance } from './bot-instance.entity';

@Entity()
export class BotStatistics {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  timestamp: Date;

  @Column()
  messagesSent: number;

  @Column()
  messagesReceived: number;

  @Column()
  activeUsers: number;

  @ManyToOne(() => BotInstance, botInstance => botInstance.statistics)
  botInstance: BotInstance;
}
```

**DirectMessage Entity**

typescript

```typescript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, ManyToOne } from 'typeorm';
import { BotInstance } from './bot-instance.entity';

@Entity()
export class DirectMessage {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  userId: number;

  @Column()
  message: string;

  @Column()
  scenario: string;

  @Column()
  goalReached: boolean;

  @ManyToOne(() => BotInstance, botInstance => botInstance.directMessages)
  botInstance: BotInstance;
}
```

Note that these entities assume a one-to-many relationship between `Bot` and `BotInstance`, a one-to-many relationship between `BotInstance` and `BotStatistics`, and a one-to-many relationship between `BotInstance` and `DirectMessage`. You can modify these entities as per your requirements.

> Create a module for bot management: This module should allow you to manage your bots, like starting, stopping, or restarting them. You can use this module to modify the bot's configuration, like changing the scenario or the library of answers. decompose this module in sub-modules

Sure, here's a possible decomposition of the bot management module into sub-modules:

1.  Bot registration sub-module: This sub-module handles the registration of new bots. It includes functionality for validating the bot token, adding a new bot to the database, and creating a new bot instance.
    
2.  Bot configuration sub-module: This sub-module handles the modification of bot configuration settings. It includes functionality for changing the scenario or the library of answers used by the bot. It also provides an interface for modifying the bot's general configuration settings, like the bot name.
    
3.  Bot status sub-module: This sub-module provides functionality for monitoring the status of bots. It includes methods for checking if a bot is currently running, as well as getting information about the bot's statistics and performance.
    
4.  Bot control sub-module: This sub-module provides functionality for controlling the behavior of bots. It includes methods for starting, stopping, and restarting bots. It also provides functionality for updating the bot's status and managing bot instances.
    
5.  Bot testing sub-module: This sub-module provides functionality for testing the bot's behavior. It includes methods for simulating user activity and sending test messages to the bot.
    

These sub-modules can be combined to create a comprehensive bot management module that handles all aspects of bot management, from registration and configuration to testing and control.

> Implement statistics collection module: This module should collect statistics about each bot's interactions with users, like the number of messages sent and received to chat group, number of messages sent and received to and from user from direct messages, which scenario used for user and did it come to an end, the number of active users, and other relevant metrics. decompose this module in sub-modules and update typeorm entities for my project

Sure, here's a possible decomposition of the statistics collection module into sub-modules:

1.  Chat group statistics sub-module: This sub-module collects statistics about a bot's interactions in chat groups. It includes functionality for tracking the number of messages sent and received, the number of active users, and other relevant metrics.
    
2.  Direct message statistics sub-module: This sub-module collects statistics about a bot's interactions in direct messages. It includes functionality for tracking the number of messages sent and received, the number of active users, and other relevant metrics. It also tracks which scenario was used for each user and whether it came to an end.
    
3.  User statistics sub-module: This sub-module collects statistics about individual users. It includes functionality for tracking the number of messages sent and received by each user, as well as other relevant metrics.
    
4.  Time-based statistics sub-module: This sub-module collects statistics over time. It includes functionality for tracking daily, weekly, and monthly metrics, as well as generating reports and visualizations.
    

These sub-modules can be combined to create a comprehensive statistics collection module that tracks all aspects of a bot's interactions with users.

Regarding the TypeORM entities, you would need to update the Bot, ChatGroup, DirectMessage, and User entities to include fields for the relevant statistics. Here's an example of how the ChatGroup entity could be updated:

typescript

```typescript
@Entity()
export class ChatGroup {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Column()
  chatId: number;

  @Column()
  botId: number;

  @OneToMany(() => Message, (message) => message.chatGroup)
  messages: Message[];

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  messagesSent: number;

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  messagesReceived: number;

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  activeUsers: number;
}
```

You would add similar fields to the other entities as needed.

> provide updated versions for all entities for my project

Sure, here are updated versions of the entities for your project, including fields for statistics collection:

1.  Bot Entity:

typescript

```typescript
@Entity()
export class Bot {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Column()
  token: string;

  @Column()
  scenario: string;

  @Column()
  library: string;

  @OneToMany(() => ChatGroup, (chatGroup) => chatGroup.bot)
  chatGroups: ChatGroup[];

  @OneToMany(() => DirectMessage, (directMessage) => directMessage.bot)
  directMessages: DirectMessage[];

  @OneToMany(() => User, (user) => user.bot)
  users: User[];

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  chatMessagesSent: number;

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  chatMessagesReceived: number;

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  directMessagesSent: number;

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  directMessagesReceived: number;

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  activeUsers: number;
}
```

2.  ChatGroup Entity:

typescript

```typescript
@Entity()
export class ChatGroup {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  name: string;

  @Column()
  chatId: number;

  @ManyToOne(() => Bot, (bot) => bot.chatGroups)
  bot: Bot;

  @OneToMany(() => Message, (message) => message.chatGroup)
  messages: Message[];

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  messagesSent: number;

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  messagesReceived: number;

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  activeUsers: number;
}
```

3.  DirectMessage Entity:

typescript

```typescript
@Entity()
export class DirectMessage {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  userId: number;

  @ManyToOne(() => Bot, (bot) => bot.directMessages)
  bot: Bot;

  @OneToMany(() => Message, (message) => message.directMessage)
  messages: Message[];

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  messagesSent: number;

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  messagesReceived: number;

  @Column({ default: '' })
  scenario: string;

  @Column({ default: false })
  scenarioEnded: boolean;
}
```

4.  User Entity:

typescript

```typescript
@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  userId: number;

  @ManyToOne(() => Bot, (bot) => bot.users)
  bot: Bot;

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  messagesSent: number;

  @Column({ default: 0 })
  messagesReceived: number;

  @Column({ default: '' })
  lastScenario: string;

  @Column({ default: false })
  scenarioEnded: boolean;
}
```

I've added fields to each entity to track the number of messages sent and received, as well as other relevant metrics, based on the requirements of the statistics collection module.
